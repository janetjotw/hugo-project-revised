# Hugo Project

## Purpose

This repository is a part of my portfolio through which I aim to showcase my Technical writing skills. In this repository, I aim to impart two main ideas:
- An how-to guide to install and configure a Python SDK library
- How to publish this guide on a website using Hugo and GitHub Actions and host it on GitHub Pages.

Weâ€™ll walk through the process of building a website using Hugo, a static site generator, and hosting it on GitHub Pages. The Hugo site is published at https://janetjotw.github.io/hugo-project-revised/
